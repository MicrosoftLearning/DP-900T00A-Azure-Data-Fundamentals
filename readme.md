# Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for Microsoft course [DP-900 *Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals*](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/dp-900t00) and the [self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/23110622/collections/0kjyh8rn5gdrjj/). The labs are designed to accompany the learning materials and enable you to practice using the technologies they describe. 

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course.  We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to allow for open contributions between the course authors and MCTs to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and make an enhancement right in the lab source.  Help your fellow MCTs.
