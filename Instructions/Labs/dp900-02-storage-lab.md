# Explore Azure Storage

In this exercise you'll provision an Azure Storage account in your Azure subscription, and explore the various ways you can use it to store data.

This lab will take approximately **15** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Provision an Azure Storage account

The first step in using Azure Storage is to provision an Azure Storage account in your Azure subscription.

1. If you haven't already done so, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
1. On the Azure portal home page, select **&#65291; Create a resource** from the upper left-hand corner and search for *Storage account*. Then in the resulting **Storage account** page, select **Create**.
1. Enter the following values on the **Create a storage account** page:
    - **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**:  Create a new resource group with a name of your choice.
    - **Storage account name**: Enter a unique name for your storage account using lower-case letters and numbers.
    - **Region**:  Select any available location.
    - **Performance**: *Standard*
    - **Redundancy**: *Locally-redundant storage (LRS)*

1. Select **Next: Advanced >** and view the advanced configuration options. In particular, note that this is where you can enable hierarchical namespace to support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. Leave this option **<u>unselected</u>** (you'll enable it later), and then select **Next: Networking >** to view the networking options for your storage account.
1. Select **Next: Data protection >** and then in the **Recovery** section, <u>de</u>select all of the **Enable soft delete...** options. These options retain deleted files for subsequent recovery, but can cause issues later when you enable hierarchical namespace.
1. Continue through the remaining **Next >** pages without changing any of the default settings, and then on the  **Review + Create** page, wait for your selections to be validated and select **Create** to create your Azure Storage account.
1. Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the resource that was deployed.

## Explore blob storage

Now that you have an Azure Storage account, you can create a container for blob data.

1. Download the [product1.json](https://aka.ms/product1.json?azure-portal=true) JSON file from `https://aka.ms/product1.json` and save it on your computer (you can save it in any folder - you'll upload it to blob storage later).

    *If the JSON file is displayed in your browser, save the page as **product1.json**.*

1. In the Azure portal page for your storage container, on the left side, in the **Data storage** section, select **Containers**.
1. In the **Containers** page, select **&#65291; Container** and add a new container named **data** with a public access level of **Private (no anonymous access)**.
1. When the **data** container has been created, verify that it's listed in the **Containers** page.
1. In the pane on the left side, in the top section, select **Storage browser**. This page provides a browser-based interface that you can use to work with the data in your storage account.
1. In the storage browser page, select **Blob containers** and verify that your **data** container is listed.
1. Select the **data** container, and note that it's empty.
1. Select **&#65291; Add Directory** and read the information about folders before creating a new directory named **products**.
1. In storage browser, verify that the current view shows the contents of the **products** folder you just created - observe that the "breadcrumbs" at the top of the page reflect the path **Blob containers > data > products**.
1. In the breadcrumbs, select **data** to switch to the **data** container, and note that it does <u>not</u> contain a folder named **products**.

    Folders in blob storage are virtual, and only exist as part of the path of a blob. Since the **products** folder contained no blobs, it isn't really there!

1. Use the **&#10514; Upload** button to open the **Upload blob** panel.
1. In the **Upload blob** panel, select the **product1.json** file you saved on your local computer previously. Then in the **Advanced** section, in the **Upload to folder** box, enter **product_data** and select the **Upload** button.
1. Close the **Upload blob** panel if it's still open, and verify that a **product_data** virtual folder has been created in the **data** container.
1. Select the **product_data** folder and verify that it contains the **product1.json** blob you uploaded.
1. On the left side, in the **Data storage** section, select **Containers**.
1. Open the **data** container, and verify that the **product_data** folder you created is listed.
1. Select the **&#x2027;&#x2027;&#x2027;** icon at the right-end of the folder, and note that it doesn't display any options. Folders in a flat namespace blob container are virtual, and can't be managed.
1. Use the **X** icon at the top right in the **data** page to close the page and return to the **Containers** page.

## Explore Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 support enables you to use hierarchical folders to organize and manage access to blobs. It also enables you to use Azure blob storage to host distributed file systems for common big data analytics platforms.

1. Download the [product2.json](https://aka.ms/product2.json?azure-portal=true) JSON file from `https://aka.ms/product2.json` and save it on your computer in the same folder where you downloaded **product1.json** previously - you'll upload it to blob storage later).
1. In the Azure portal page for your storage account, on the left side, scroll down to the **Settings** section, and select **Data Lake Gen2 upgrade**.
1. In the **Data Lake Gen2 upgrade** page, expand and complete each step to upgrade your storage account to enable hierarchical namespace and support Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2. This may take some time.
1. When the upgrade is complete, in the pane on the left side, in the top section, select **Storage browser** and navigate back to the root of your **data** blob container, which still contains the **product_data** folder.
1. Select the **product_data** folder, and verify it still contains the **product1.json** file you uploaded previously.
1. Use the **&#10514; Upload** button to open the **Upload blob** panel.
1. In the **Upload blob** panel, select the **product2.json** file you saved on your local computer. Then select the **Upload** button.
1. Close the **Upload blob** panel if it's still open, and verify that a **product_data** folder now contains the **product2.json** file.
1. On the left side, in the **Data storage** section, select **Containers**.
1. Open the **data** container, and verify that the **product_data** folder you created is listed.
1. Select the **&#x2027;&#x2027;&#x2027;** icon at the right-end of the folder, and note that with hierarchical namespace enabled, you can perform configuration tasks at the folder-level; including renaming folders and setting permissions.
1. Use the **X** icon at the top right in the **data** page to close the page and return to the **Containers** page.

## Explore Azure Files

Azure Files provides a way to create cloud-based file shares.

1. In the Azure portal page for your storage container, on the left side, in the **Data storage** section, select **File shares**.
1. In the File shares page, select **&#65291; File share** and add a new file share named **files** using the **Transaction optimized** tier.
1. In the **File shares**, open your new **files** share.
1. At the top of the page, select **Connect**. Then in the **Connect** pane, note that there are tabs for common operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS) that contain scripts you can run to connect to the shared folder from a client computer.
1. Close the **Connect** pane and then close the **files** page to return to the **File shares** page for your Azure storage account.

## Explore Azure Tables

Azure Tables provide a key/value store for applications that need to store data values, but don't need the full functionality and structure of a relational database.

1. In the Azure portal page for your storage container, on the left side, in the **Data storage** section, select **Tables**.
1. On the **Tables** page, select **&#65291; Table** and create a new table named **products**.
1. After the **products** table has been created, in the pane on the left side, in the top section, select **Storage browser**.
1. In storage explorer, select **Tables** and verify that the **products** table is listed.
1. Select the **products** table.
1. In the **product** page, select **&#65291; Add entity**.
1. In the **Add entity** panel, enter the following key values:
    - **PartitionKey**: 1
    - **RowKey**: 1
1. Select **Add property**, and create a new property with the following values:

    |Property name | Type | Value |
    | ------------ | ---- | ----- |
    | Name | String | Widget |

1. Add a second property with the following values:

    |Property name | Type | Value |
    | ------------ | ---- | ----- |
    | Price | Double | 2.99 |

1. Select **Insert** to insert a row for the new entity into the table.
1. In storage browser, verify that a row has been added to the **products** table, and that a **Timestamp** column has been created to indicate when the row was last modified.
1. Add another entity to the **products** table with the following properties:

    |Property name | Type | Value |
    | ------------ | ---- | ----- |
    | PartitionKey | String | 1 |
    | RowKey | String | 2 |
    | Name | String | Kniknak |
    | Price | Double | 1.99 |
    | Discontinued | Boolean | true |

1. After inserting the new entity, verify that a row containing the discontinued product is shown in the table.

    You have manually entered data into the table using the storage browser interface. In a real scenario, application developers can use the Azure Storage Table API to build applications that read and write values to tables, making it a cost effective and scalable solution for NoSQL storage.

> **Tip**: If you've finished exploring Azure Storage, you can delete the resource group that you created in this exercise.
