# Explore Azure Cosmos DB

In this exercise you'll provision an Azure Cosmos DB database in your Azure subscription, and explore the various ways you can use it to store non-relational data.

This lab will take approximately **15** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

You'll need an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) in which you have administrative-level access.

## Create a Cosmos DB account

To use Cosmos DB, you must provision a Cosmos DB account in your Azure subscription. In this exercise, you'll provision a Cosmos DB account that uses Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL.

1. In the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource** at the top left, and search for *Azure Cosmos DB*.  In the results, select **Azure Cosmos DB** and select  **Create**.
1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** tile, select **Create**.
1. Enter the following details, and then select **Review + Create**:
    - **Subscription**: If you're using a sandbox, select *Concierge Subscription*. Otherwise, select your Azure subscription.
    - **Resource group**:  If you're using a sandbox, select the existing resource group (which will have a name like *learn-xxxx...*). Otherwise, create a new resource group with a name of your choice.
    - **Account Name**: Enter a unique name
    - **Location**: Choose any recommended location
    - **Capacity mode**: Provisioned throughput
    - **Apply Free-Tier Discount**: Select Apply if available
    - **Limit total account throughput**: Unselected
1. When the configuration has been validated, select **Create**.
1. Wait for deployment to complete. Then go to the deployed resource.

## Create a sample database

*Throughout this procedure, close any tips that are displayed in the portal*.

1. On the page for your new Cosmos DB account, in the pane on the left, select **Data Explorer**.
1. In the **Data Explorer** page, select **Launch quick start**.
1. In the **New container** tab, review the pre-populated settings for the sample database, and then select **OK**.
1. Observe the status in the panel at the bottom of the screen until the **SampleDB** database and its **SampleContainer** container has been created (which may take a minute or so).

## View and create items

1. In the Data Explorer page, expand the **SampleDB** database and the **SampleContainer** container, and select **Items** to see a list of items in the container. The items represent product data, each with a unique id and other properties.
1. Select any of the items in the list to see a JSON representation of the item data.
1. At the top of the page, select **New Item** to create a new blank item.
1. Modify the JSON for the new item as follows, and then select **Save**.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Road Helmet,45",
        "id": "123456789",
        "categoryID": "123456789",
        "SKU": "AB-1234-56",
        "description": "The product called \"Road Helmet,45\" ",
        "price": 48.74
    }
    ```

1. After saving the new item, notice that additional metadata properties are added automatically.

## Query the database

1. In the **Data Explorer** page, select the **New SQL Query** icon.
1. In the SQL Query editor, review the default query (`SELECT * FROM c`) and use the **Execute Query** button to run it.
1. Review the results, which includes the full JSON representation of all items.
1. Modify the query as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM c
    WHERE CONTAINS(c.name,"Helmet")
    ```

1. Use the **Execute Query** button to run the revised query and review the results, which includes JSON entities for any items with a **name** field containing the text "Helmet".
1. Close the SQL Query editor, discarding your changes.

    You've seen how to create and query JSON entities in a Cosmos DB database by using the data explorer interface in the Azure portal. In a real scenario, an application developer would use one of the many programming language specific software development kits (SDKs) to call the NoSQL API and work with data in the database.

> **Tip**: If you've finished exploring Azure Cosmos DB, you can delete the resource group that you created in this exercise.
